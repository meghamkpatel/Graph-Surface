# Graph-Surface

In this project, I wanted to display a line that the user can change. As the user changed the line, the screen would display the length of the line and the x and y position of the point the user clicked. 
I created this app by creating a SurfaceView and creating a Canvas object where I drew the line on. 
I originally had trouble with the app because I wanted the user to input the slope and y-intercept and display a graph from that data in another page. Moreover, I was not sure how to use the SurfaceView container to make the app interactive because there was issues with converting from android to androidx. I was also trying to use the Tabbed Activity and was not sure how to connect the data from both pages. I still wanted to make the app interactive so I decided to have the user choose the point.
